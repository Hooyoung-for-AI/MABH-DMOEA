Please refer to the code folder for the full code of MABH-DMOEA. Since the dynamic multi-objective optimization framework implemented by the native platEMO has some minor bugs, some fine-tuning was done in the underlying population update step, but it does not affect the final result of the algorithm. The adjusted platEMO and MABH-DMOEA are saved in the zip file, which also contains the specific design of the ablation experiment.
